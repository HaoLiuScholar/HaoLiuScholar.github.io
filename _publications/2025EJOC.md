The aggregation-induced asymmetric synthesis (AIAS) of trans-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran compounds is achieved via the reaction of salicyl N-phosphonyl imines with sulfur ylide. This transformation proceeds through a [4 + 1] annulation pathway, affording products in good to excellent yields with tunable diastereoselectivities. By employing various THF/EtOH cosolvent systems in conjunction with GAP chemistry, the conventional aggregation cosolvent systems are shown to play a crucial role in enhancing diastereoselectivity and modulating aggregate formation. This is supported by studies involving aggregation-induced emission, aggregation-induced polarization, and dynamic light scattering. The developed protocol provides a practical and versatile synthetic approach to 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran scaffolds, highlighting the utility of AIAS as a powerful strategy for achieving stereocontrol.
