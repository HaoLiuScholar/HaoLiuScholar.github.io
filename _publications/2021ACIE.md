Directed C−H functionalization has been realized as a complimentary technique to achieve borylation at a distal position of aliphatic amines. Here, we demonstrated the oxidative borylation at the distal δ-position of aliphatic amines using various borylating agents, a palladium catalyst, and a rightly tuned ligand in the presence of a cheap oxidant. Moreover, an organopalladium δ-C(sp3)-H-activated intermediate has been isolated and crystallographically characterized to get mechanistic insight.
