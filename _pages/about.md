Dr. Hao Liu received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from Texas Tech University, specializing in organic chemistry, molecular chirality, medicinal and bioorganic chemistry, and polymer chemistry. His research interests center on the design and asymmetric synthesis of multilayer 3D chiral frameworks and functional polymers, including aggregation-induced emissive and redox-active materials, and on their potential applications in functional materials and chemical biology. He teaches undergraduate courses in general and organic chemistry laboratories at Texas Tech University’s Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry.
